Head on over to your account settings, scroll down, click `Delete` enter some parting thoughts and confirm. Go outside and touch grass, as the kids say. The best social network has always been your contacts app.<!-- excerpt -->

Reddit has, pretty clearly, demonstrated contempt for its users through its API changes and behavior towards them after said changes. Next up, it's going to make money by selling exclusive access to all the nonsense, advice and time you've invested into **their** platform so that an extractive AI model can be trained on it. I'm sure there'll be more ads too[^1].

You invested in their platform, now they're selling you out to investors. The platform will only, inexorably get worse for everyone logging into it.

(Oh and good lord, delete your Twitter account too.)

[^1]: Or they'll just get more invasive and grating.
