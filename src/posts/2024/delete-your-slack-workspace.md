Slack updated their terms of service, announcing plans to train AI/ML models on customer datas which is, frankly, super gross.<!-- excerpt -->

**[From their new policy:](https://slack.com/trust/data-management/privacy-principles)**
> ...our systems analyze Customer Data (e.g. messages, content, and files) submitted to Slack as well as Other Information (including usage information) as defined in our Privacy Policy and in your customer agreement.

You *can* opt out but they make it nice and cumbersome by opting everyone *in* and requiring that you send an email to a feedback address. Good luck!

If you're forced, for work or an utterly daunting migration (still worth considering given how little respect this all demonstrates for users), you should at least try and opt out:

1. Email [feedback@slack.com](mailto:feedback@slack.com)
2. Subject line: `Slack Global model opt-out request`.
3. Message: You workspace address and a message of appreciation for their policy change.

Or, ideally, delete your workspace and leave some nice feedback on your way out:

1. From your desktop, click your workspace name in the sidebar.ï¿¼
2. Click Tools & settings, then select `Workspace settings`.
3. Scroll down to `Delete Workspace`.
4. Click `Delete Workspace`.
5. Check the box to confirm you want to delete the workspace.
6. Enter your Slack account password and click `Yes, delete my workspace`.
