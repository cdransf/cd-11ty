*This applies to full-time employment, but still.* I've encountered all of these (all in the same role — and yes, hindsight is 20/20!). I've had several *excellent* roles since and experienced none of this since.<!-- excerpt -->

- There's no HR department[^1].
- You have to use your own equipment.
- You have little to no autonomy.
- You're regularly contacted outside of work hours (without being formally on call).
  - You're reprimanded for taking sick time.
  - You're reprimanded for not being available during scheduled PTO.
    - Your employer checks up on your social media and holds activity against you.
- You're not paid out for compensation duly owed.
- You're forced to wear 3-4 hats, but paid less than the wage expected for working one.
- You're threatened with a lawsuit for changing your notice period in an at-will state.
- You're asked to engage in unethical behavior on the owner's behalf.

I'm sure there are many, many more things that could fit in such a list (I'd be happy to hear them and offer sympathy — or commiseration).
