We've seen Meta, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Reddit, Automattic, Mozilla — name a company — integrate AI that continues to be trained on public data with or without creator consent.<!-- excerpt -->

Now, more than ever, it's critical to look to open platforms where you can host and control your own content and adopt a defensible position wherein you seek to deny access to all the myriad crawlers used by AI companies.

Who knows which platform will adopt a dubious AI implementation to bolster flagging profits next, all at the expense of their users.

Build a site or, if you're a developer, contribute to tools that make building a site easier. Share open links, adopt open platforms and eschew companies looking to profit from your data without your consent.[^1]

Companies aren't building products that provide value to their users anymore. They're building products that convince investors they can grow forever and they're doing so at their users' expense.

[^1]: *Any* adoption of this should be opt in, not opt out (here's looking at you Tumblr/Automattic).
