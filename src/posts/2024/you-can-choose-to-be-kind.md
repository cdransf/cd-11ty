It's trite, but it's true and maybe, just maybe, the phrase has been burned into my brain from my kids watching *[Daniel Tiger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Tiger%27s_Neighborhood)* on repeat. I've found it to be the best way to approach interactions in life and online — you can and should be kind to yourself too.<!-- excerpt -->

I struggle with the be kind to yourself bit — I'm extremely self critical and I find it hard to get past that, I always have. I imagine it's a blend of imposter syndrome and the lack of confidence that that stems from. It's a nice goal to keep an eye on though and something I try and practice on an ongoing basis.

I always want to be an optimist and my interest in being kind, perhaps, is rooted in that. I'm not sure. I know, well, *everything* makes optimism hard to maintain lately. Perhaps it's being a parent — modeling kindness is critical and having kids demands optimism. I *love* being a parent and I will always want the best for them. They deserve a world better than we currently have on offer — culturally, technologically and ecologically. Kindness can, would and should yield something better than what we have at the moment.

<strong class="highlight-text">So, take a beat, take a breath and be kind. You'll be better for it, we'll all be better for it.</strong>
