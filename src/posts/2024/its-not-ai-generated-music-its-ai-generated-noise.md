I'm going to harp on this again but, yes, yes AI-generated content is derivative. Music is appealing *because* it is an innately human, creative act. It could be something as ugly as death metal, as soothing as ambient music or as joyful as pop can tend to be.<!-- excerpt -->

An AI application will mimic these characteristics but will fail to capture what it sets out to devalue.

I don't want AI created art, there is no value there. Generative AI will increase the volume of available content and data, but we already have a glut of that. The original creators of art and music are already struggling to make a living.

I'm not interested in a promised technological future wherein we stream music generated upstream by AI that was trained on output artists have poured themselves into only to be cast aside and left to starve.

A future that devoid of empathy, passion, care and interest in the human condition is one that deserves "music" and "art" that's as soulless as the tools its used to devalue the work of proper artists.

This is "music" created by people that never cared about artists for an audience that never understood music to begin with.

Remember [Tom Petty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Petty)? The man made great music â€” I'll listen to those records fondly. I'm not excited about sonic junk dumped out of an overworked GPU.
