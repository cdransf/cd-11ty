Everything and everyone is stapling AI into their existing products at the moment. Can we get a counterbalance, a category of products that *don't* include it?<!-- excerpt -->

"This product was built for users not as a demonstration to investors that we're chasing the latest trend."

Develop a simple, focused app that does what it says on the tin — not one where the tin talks back at you.

You build the tool, keep it as simple as possible and it does what you set out for it to do. Your customers see the value and use it accordingly.

No AI in the product.

Less noise, less confusion, less chatter and more focus. Those are the products I want — the products that add AI "features" when they worked perfectly well before are products I'll gladly leave behind.
