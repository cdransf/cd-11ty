You don't need a framework for *any* website primarily focused on presenting information to users.<!-- excerpt -->

You don't need a JavaScript framework, you don't need a CSS framework.

If you're operating at scale, you need accepted and agreed upon best practices for your team.

You might want to consider a framework if you're building a web *application*.

That we've spent years conflating sites and applications feels like a failure of education and imagination.
