*Check, check, check, clear the queue, close the rings, get to zero.*

I know this looks neurotic, it is neurotic because *I'm* neurotic. I always have been, or at least as long as I can remember.

I've got anxiety and this helps me cope with it â€” other things do too, but routine is important and, when you get right down it it, that routine is a series of boxes that get checked.[^3]

*Check, check, check, clear the queue, close the rings, get to zero.*
