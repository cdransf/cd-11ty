Look, I get that publications are hurting for revenue and AI companies are handing out cash but you're not *just* providing access to written and human-generated output — you're giving up goodwill.<!-- excerpt -->

Everyone is free to rationalize these deals and take the money — I can't stop that. But, if you're going to leverage AI tools that we all know to hallucinate in the context of journalistic output, I won't be able to trust that input. Perhaps, with some transparency into how it's used, but I don't expect that we'll get that.

I want real — human — reporting. We should value and support journalistic institutions and throwing money at them to treat their content as more grist for the AI mill doesn't qualify.
