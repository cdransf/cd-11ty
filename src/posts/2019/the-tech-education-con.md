> Public education, like any institution, has to change with the times. Learning digital skills like coding should be part of any twenty-first century educational program.<!-- excerpt -->
>
> But tech giants’ interest in remaking our education systems isn’t altruistic. We have to remain skeptical of their technological solutionism and tax-evading philanthropy.
>
> As education is taken over by private corporations, with tech companies playing a key role, and the White House continuing to promote STEM as the only solution for students, we should ask: who benefits from a growing supply of reserve tech labor? Who wins from the nationwide push for STEM? And what is lost in the single-minded pursuit of this goal?
