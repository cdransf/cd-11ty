I've been reading a lot lately (mainly on my phone when I catch a spare moment). I've picked up several books on front end development and am currently digging in to _JavaScript: The Good Parts_ by [Douglas Crockford](http://www.crockford.com).<!-- excerpt --> I've been trying to dial in on an area of focus when reading about development and, for now, I think I'm settling in on JavaScript and a bit of Python. In addition to Crockford's book I'm planning on reading a book on [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com) and the framework's documentation.

For now, my backlog looks like this:

- _JavaScript: The Good Parts_
- _Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS_
- _Building Web Apps with Ember.js_
- _Head First Python_
- _Flask Web Development_
