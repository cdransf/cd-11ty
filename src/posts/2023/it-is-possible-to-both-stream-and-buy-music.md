> Streaming services are all the piracy with none of the guilt. It is a broken model that is only slightly better than when this stuff came through illicit downloads from risky places. If someone can buy music outright, artists will benefit, but I cannot see how it implicitly makes them a better music enjoyer.

[I've been streaming music again](https://coryd.dev/posts/2023/i-dont-want-streaming-music/) in part (and I know this is ridiculous) because Spotify is ubiquitous, well-integrated and has a — well — [API that's usable for my purposes](https://coryd.dev/posts/2023/road-to-madness-apple-music-charts/). I still buy music I stream from Bandcamp and archive it and I still buy too many shirts to support bands (I also import missing music into playlists and playlist folders as an analog to albums). I've also been able to scrobble listens more reliably and found some really great bands like [PUP](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6A7uqgC2N1nUhrCLAytHxN). We'll see if it lasts, but it feels like a good balance for now.<!-- excerpt -->
