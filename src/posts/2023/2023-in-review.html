<p>Here's my brief, altogether incomplete, review of 2023.</p><!-- excerpt -->
<ul>
  <li>Our son turned 1! (Kids are <em>awesome</em>.)</li>
  <li>I kept writing front end code â€” I have loved diving into <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> and the community around it.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> community has also been incredible to hang around with and I should pop into the Discord more.</li>
  <li>I got 4 more tattoos done in as many sessions, with 2 more sessions scheduled for next year.</li>
  <li><a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/coryd">I read 71 books</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.last.fm/user/coryd_">I listened to a bunch of music</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://trakt.tv/users/cdransf">I watched a bunch of movies and TV</a>, but picking favorites feels weird when so much of that consisted of catching up on "classics" and things I'd either ignored or never seen.</li>
</ul>
