[A fantastastic read](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/top-javascript-frameworks-topics-to-learn-in-2017-700a397b711#.2micvl2c8) by [Eric Elliott](https://ericelliottjs.com) on what to stay on top of in the ever-changing JavaScript ecosystem in 2017.<!-- excerpt -->

Personally, I've been focusing in on [React](https://facebook.github.io/react), [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) and the tooling ecosystem surrounding both. I can't wait to see what else next year brings.

I've been reading quite a bit this year as well and have particularly enjoyed:
