> "If the government believes that location data is sensitive and requires more explicit consumer disclosures and permissions," he continued, "then those protections should apply to all players that have access to location data, whether an ISP or edge player or search engine."

No, customers should be able to expect that their data remain private and, the fact of the matter is, customers typically have a choice who they provide their data to (whether that be Facebook, Google — you name it).<!-- excerpt --> Where most people in the U.S. live, there's often only one ISP for customers to get a connection from — they shouldn't be forced to have sensitive data exposed to that company purely for the benefit of that company.

If ISPs are upset about perceived competitors having access to different data sets than they do, they should come up with a competitive service that people actually want to use that can actually compete. [Or maybe they'll keep buying failed tech companies and mashing them together in a hilarious rebranding effort.](http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/3/15166872/aol-verizon-oath-announced-merger-rebranding-new-name-logo)
