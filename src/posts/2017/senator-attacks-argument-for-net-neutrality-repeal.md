**[Senator Edward Markey, Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/?p=1135805ï¿¼):**

> ISPs are quick to tell the FCC and the public that Title II is harming network investment, but they have presented a much rosier view when talking to investors.<!-- excerpt -->

ISPs are _already_ investing in infrastructure with existing regulations in place. They want net neutrality restrictions repealed so that they can more freely continue their existing abusing and anticompetitive behavior[^1].

A better fix for this problem would be to encourage more competition in the market, rather than shred regulations covering existing companies with near-monopoly positions and an extensive track record of anticompetitive and customer-hostile behavior.

[^1]: If ISPs are threatened by Netflix, they should try competing by creating a service that doesn't suck.
