> In light of a Congress that long ago made it clear that it prioritizes telecom cash contributions over consumers, the best "solution" for net neutrality at this juncture would be leaving the existing rules -- and the FCC's authority over broadband providers -- intact.<!-- excerpt -->

The unfortunate reality of the situation is that the current administration will always prefer the vested interest of corporate telecoms and lobbyists over those of the consumers they serve. Reversing net neutrality will be harmful to consumers and [to any number of businesses](http://www.theverge.com/2017/2/3/14495750/snapchat-ipo-net-neutrality-cost-fcc-hurt-business) â€” here's hoping that net neutrality is, somehow, able to survive.
