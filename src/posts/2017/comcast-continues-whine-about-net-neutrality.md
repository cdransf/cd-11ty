This is, of course, nonsense as the article goes on to explain. Comcast and so many of the other players in the net neutrality argument appear to either miss or intentionally bury the point: in the absence of competition, consumers and the open internet need net neutrality protections. Failing that, customers need dramatically more choice in selecting an ISP.

Comcast would love to gut those protections, double dip by charging competitors for access to its network before then passing those costs on to its reluctant customers. If Comcast is frustrated at losing revenue to new competitors it should make products people actually want to use and that compete rather than focusing on strong arming regulatory bodies intended to protect consumers from exactly this kind of behavior.
