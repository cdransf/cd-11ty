> ... anybody that actually cares about net neutrality should support the simplest and easiest way to protect consumers, startups and small businesses moving forward: keep the existing rules intact.<!-- excerpt -->

Comcast's argument that gutting existing net neutrality rules will help members of protected classes is totally disingenuous. The best way to protect consumers and the open internet across the board is to leave the existing rules intact. Comcast has only its best interests in mind, not those of their customers or any other consumers.
