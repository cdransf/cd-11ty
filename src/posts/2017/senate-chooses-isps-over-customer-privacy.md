> ISPs act as gatekeepers to the Internet, giving them incredible access to records of what you do online. They shouldn't be able to profit off of the information about what you search for, read about, purchase, and more without your consent.<!-- excerpt -->

I truly wish I could be shocked or surprised by a move like this coming out of the senate but, lately, congress appears to be dedicated to making decisions that actively harm their constituencies in order to benefit entrenched business interests.

This action needs to fail in the house. ISPs occupy a privileged position that gives them detailed access to customer data, and they should not be able to freely exploit that data for financial gain.
