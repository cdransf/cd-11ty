title: 'Ending net neutrality will end the Internet as we know it'
description: "The path forward is clear. The FCC must abandon its ill-conceived plan to end net neutrality. Instead of creating fast lanes for the few, it should be moving all of us to the fast lane by encouraging competition in local broadband connectivity and pushing companies to deliver higher speeds at more affordable prices. It's the right thing for us as consumers and as citizens."
