> The lobby groups want a ruling that the FCC exceeded its statutory authority by reclassifying broadband as a common carrier service. Such a ruling could prevent future FCCs from implementing net neutrality rules as strict as the current ones, which outlaw blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization. A ruling for the industry could also prevent future FCCs from reviving other consumer protections that are likely to be overturned by the commission's current Republican majority.<!-- excerpt -->

None of this would be necessary if ISPs and cable companies were capable of creating and providing services that consumers actually wanted to use. Instead, they pursue legal action to cripple competitors and force consumers to use their, at best, substandard services.
