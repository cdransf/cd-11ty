**[Andy Yen, TED.com](http://ideas.ted.com/why-we-should-all-care-about-encryption-really/):**

> If we squander privacy by allowing back doors or building illicit vulnerabilities into encryption tools, there is nothing to protect us from prying corporations, spying governments or even criminals bent on abusing our data. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a back door that only lets the good guys in.

> Data must always be encrypted, end-to-end, period â€” before it leaves your computer. Privacy is a fundamental right. Let's not squander it in the name of security.<!-- excerpt -->
