> "To date, most of the FCC's actions have ignored the needs of consumers," said Rep. Frank Pallone, the New Jersey Democrat. "Too often, when given the choice, this FCC has sided with large corporations to the detriment of hardworking Americans."<!-- excerpt -->

> "Chairman Pai, in the time you have been the head of this agency, we have seen an agenda that is anti-consumer, anti-small business, anti-competition, anti-innovation, and anti-opportunity," said Rep. Mike Doyle, the Pennsylvania Democrat. "I am deeply concerned that the FCC is on the wrong a path, a path that will hurt small businesses, regular people, and some of the most innovative sectors of our economy."

The current incarnation of the FCC is entirely pro-industry and anti-consumer in its approach to regulating the market it oversees.

Chairman Pai's argument is misleading at best, particularly given the admission of ISPs that the current net neutrality rules have not harmed investment. Should the current rules be repealed, ISPs likely won't materially increase their infrastructure investments. Instead, they'll use the lack of oversight and regulations to line their pockets at the expense of competitors that require access to their networks and consumers that have no other choice but to pay for their service when selecting an internet service provider.

> "Although you stated the [September 7] hearing was an inquiry into the 'Internet ecosystem,' you once again failed to recognize how important the Internet is for consumers, small businesses, entrepreneurs, political organizers, public interest groups, and people looking for work," Doyle and Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-N.J.) said
