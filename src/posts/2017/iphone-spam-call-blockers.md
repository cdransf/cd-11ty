I've tried all the apps Marco calls out in this post and I agree with his assessment of all of them. I liked [Nomorobo](https://www.nomorobo.com) a lot, and it worked reliably, but I've settled on a different app that wasn't called out in this post. I've been using [Callblock](https://callblockapp.com) for the past week and like that its database extends beyond the robocallers covered by Nomorobo. It's already blocked a few calls and nothing that shouldn't get through has gotten through.
