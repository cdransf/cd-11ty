I was finally able to see The National for the first time. The band has been promoting their newest release, _Trouble Will Find Me_ on the road but, after having missed them at Outside Lands, the Greek Theatre and the Hollywood Forever Cemetary, my final shot to catch them on this run through California was their performance at _Jimmy Kimmel Live_.<!-- excerpt -->

The band ran through cuts from their newest record at a breakneck pace that I didn't expect having listened to them exclusively on record up to that point.

Matt Berninger and company ran through "Graceless" and "This Is The Last Time" for Kimmel's audience before breaking out the wine, upping the tempo and getting in to other highlights from _Trouble Will Find Me_ ("Sea of Love", most notably).

Berninger also broke out the wine after the TV cameras stopped rolling.

> Are we off the air? Ok, I can drink wine then.

If you get the chance to see The National on this run, don't hesitate to do so.

**Setlist:**

1. Graceless
2. This Is The Last Time
3. Don't Swallow the Cap
4. Sea of Love
5. Pink Rabbits
