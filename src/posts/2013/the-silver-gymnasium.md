This is an extremely creative and well-executed move by Okkervil River to promote their new album, _The Silver Gymnasium_.<!-- excerpt --> The game is well-developed and evokes immediate nostalgia if you've ever played any older, 8-bit video games.

I can't wait to get my hands on the new album and see the band at The Wiltern in October.
