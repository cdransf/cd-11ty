The most recent entry in to the Santa Monica Pier's Twilight Concert series featured Bombino and Hanni El Khatib performing to a packed crowd on the pier that spilled out on to the beach.<!-- excerpt --> The weather and setting was picturesque, though Bombino's opening set was lackluster. I wasn't familiar with their music but it consisted of a jangly guitar melody, bouncy drum beat and slightly varied tempos.

Hanni El Khatib put on a strong, energetic performance (though the supporting guitarist/bassist were a bit dull). The sound was muddy but not overly hampered as the band ran through covers and tracks from both of his full length albums.

Overall it was a great show, a nice crowd and a fantastic setting for a concert. (It was also sponsored by myspace â€” the new myspace.)
