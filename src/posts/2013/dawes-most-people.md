A wonderful new video for one of the highlights of Dawes' most recent album _Stories Don't End_. I love videos from bands that give an insight in to live shows from both their perspective and that of their fans.<!-- excerpt --> The format steps away from the "video as a portrayal of a song's subject" approach and, instead, presents what goes in to bringing that song to life for fans night in and night out.

Damien Jurado gave "Museum of Flight" off of _Maraqopa_ a similar treatment that's also very [much worth checking out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCcAKNSJ3Ac).
