I've been a fan of Godspeed You! Black Emperor since high school and finally got the chance to see them live. The band put on a devastating, energetic performance that was worth the nine or so year wait it took to see them.<!-- excerpt -->

Godspeed's set began with a low, droning noise as the band took the stage, lurching in to a noisy clamor and building to the first of many crescendos. The band played through classic pieces from their discography, silhouetted against a backdrop of Efrim Munick's rapidly shifting film footage. As the set progressed, members of the band shifted from instrument to instrument, as the sound changed and shifted with them. The performance progressed and grew with the visuals behind the band, developing in to a fully-realized performance piece rather than simply feeling like another concert.

If you get the chance to see Godspeed You! Black Emperor in the future, jump at the chance. They are easily one of the most incredible acts I've had the pleasure of seeing live. Brilliant.

**Setlist:**

1. Hope Drone
2. Mladic
3. Chart #3
4. World Police and Friendly Fire
