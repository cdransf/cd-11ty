[I'm not quite sure what to make of this new track.](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/blitzen-trapper-visit-old-memories-in-ever-loved-once-song-premiere-20130730) It's a mellow, well-written song that's consistent with Blitzen Trapper's past material but it doesn't quite make the connection that their previous hits did.<!-- excerpt -->

The production feels a bit light and monotonous but I don't think that's what feels off here. I'm curious to hear what the rest of the album sounds like but I'm not quite sure where to set my expectations for it.
