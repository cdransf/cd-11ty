Dawes played an acoustic set at the Whole Foods in West Hollywood to celebrate Whole Foods adding a record store to the location. Brothers Taylor and Griffin Goldsmith were joined on stage by Tay Strathairn with the elder Goldsmith leading the band through a range of songs from the band's 3 albums."<!-- excerpt -->

> "It's a great honor to play on front of Whole Foods. God knows we've put enough money into this place." - Taylor Goldsmith

Taylor's voice was the highlight of what was an inspired set of songs well-suited to the acoustic format. The band stuck to longer songs that benefited from the 3 members on stage harmonizing and backed by a guitar, light percussion and the ever-present sound of LA traffic.

If you get the chance to see Dawes on the road supporting _Stories Don't End_, do not hesitate to go. They are truly a fantastic live act.

**Setlist:**

1. Just Beneath the Surface
2. Million Dollar Bill
3. Someone Will
4. Love Is All I Am
5. Hey Lover [^heylover]
6. A Little Bit of Everything
