> "The connection to parents' music isn't entirely surprising. Music plays a central role in child rearing, both in the songs children are taught at home and in school and in those heard more informally as part of the home environment. The songs parents choose to listen to reflect their taste, their values, their era."

Great read via NPR.<!-- excerpt --> Music means a great deal to me personally and, the older I get, the more I keep going back to the music I listened to with my parents as a kid. There's nothing quite like re-exploring old songs and albums that helped shape and guide my taste in music to where it is now.
