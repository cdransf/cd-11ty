Damien Jurado has been one of my favorite musicians for years. He's a talented, albeit nervous, performer and a gifted songwriter.<!-- excerpt --> The announcement that he'll have a new record out in 2014 is exciting and something that I am very much looking forward to. If the new material he played live when I saw him at the Bootleg Theater in April is any indication it should be even more experimental and unique than _Maraqopa_. I cannot wait to hear it.
