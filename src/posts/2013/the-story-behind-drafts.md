A nice, brief interview with Greg Pierce, the developer of [Drafts](http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/).<!-- excerpt --> Drafts has become an integral part of how I work from my phone and interact with other apps on it. I use Drafts for quick notes, composing emails, generating lists â€” you name it. Drafts has a permanent place in my dock and I can't wait to see what Pierce adds to the app next.
