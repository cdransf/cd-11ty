[A nice, brief interview with _Elle_:](http://www.elle.com/news/culture/the-head-and-the-heart-outside-lands-2013)

> Though the album itself won't see the light of day for weeks, the Seattle alt-folk, rock sextet has been testing out the new stuff on rapt audiences over the course of the past few months, letting the clap-happy "Shake" and the earnest build of "Another Story" sweep over curious audiences eager to hear what the band's been mulling over since "Lost In My Mind" became a playlist classic in 2011.

I cannot wait to get my hands on _Let's Be Still_ and finally see The Head and The Heart live.<!-- excerpt --> I've listened to their debut countless times since first discovering the band and, if "Shake" is any indication of the direction the band took on the new album, I will be doing the same as soon as _Let's Be Still_ is released.
