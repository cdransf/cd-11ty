> It sounds like Arcade Fire in the way that only Arcade Fire sound like Arcade Fire, you know? It's really fucking epic. Seriously.

It took me longer than it should have to get in to Arcade Fire but I have been absolutely hooked of late.<!-- excerpt --> This album should be genuinely incredible (especially given the band's track record and Murphy's involvement).
