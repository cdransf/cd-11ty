I've been seeing more incoming spam calls from numbers similar to mine recently. They're annoying in large part because traditional iOS call blockers like [Hiya](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hiya-caller-id-and-block/id986999874?mt=8), [Nomorobo](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nomorobo-robocall-blocking/id1134727588?mt=8) and so forth don't screen them out (these apps apparently due this to err on the side of caution and avoid blocking what they see as legitimate local calls).<!-- excerpt -->

To mitigate this I've started using a simple app called [Wideprotect](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wideprotect-block-call-sms-mms/id1171024059) that lets you block numbers by providing a set of digits for it to match against (e.g. your area code or your area code plus the first three numbers of the phone number). If you haven't tried the app yet, and you're seeing the same issue, I'd _highly_ recommend giving it a try.
