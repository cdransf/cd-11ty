> "They want us to just trust them to protect net neutrality, and I think history shows that we can't just have a leap of faith," Wiener said. "The ISPs have violated net neutrality in the past, and they will in the future. The economic pressure will be too great for them not to violate net neutrality, so we need to have some rules in place."<!-- excerpt -->

I'm thrilled to see this bill making a comeback, compromises aside. The FCC totally abdicated their responsibility to protect customers from abuse by ISPs and states should move quickly to protect their residents and restore these freedoms.
