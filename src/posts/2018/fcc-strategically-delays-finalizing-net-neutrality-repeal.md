> Pai has been fond of saying that the net neutrality repeal hasn't harmed consumers, but that's a pretty low bar to clear given that the rules are still in effect.<!-- excerpt -->

> If the rules were eliminated this week and ISPs began violating net neutrality while Congress is negotiating a permanent net neutrality law, it would be harder for Republicans to force Democrats to compromise, Feld said. "This has all been about trying to push Democrats to compromise and adopt weak legislation."

This all reads like a textbook case of regulatory capture. Of course ISPs will abuse their market positions when this is repealed and they should have absolutely no input on net neutrality legislation.

Fortunately, [states like California are leading the way with their own net neutrality laws](http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-net-neutrality-california-20180420-story.html), but that's only if said laws manage to hold up to inevitable legal challenges of their own.
