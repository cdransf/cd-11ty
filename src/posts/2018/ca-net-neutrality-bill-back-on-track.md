> The bill enshrines not only the fundamentals of net neutrality, such as prohibiting ISPs from throttling or blocking sites, but also prohibits other telecom trickery, such as zero ratingâ€”a practice where companies provide access to certain parts of the internet for "free" and charge for others.<!-- excerpt -->

This is really heartening news, particularly the fact that it addresses anti-competitive practices like zero rating. I appreciate that the state government is taking up the challenge of addressing abuses by ISPs where the federal government has let things slide.
