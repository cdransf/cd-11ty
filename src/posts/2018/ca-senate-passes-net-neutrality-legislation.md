> The California State Senate yesterday approved a bill to impose net neutrality restrictions on Internet service providers, challenging the Federal Communications Commission attempt to preempt such rules.<!-- excerpt -->

This is a positive first step and one that will, hopefully, be taken up and passed through the state house before being signed into law. It'll be interesting to see how this plays out with the FCC's language preemption language includes in their original order. Ideally it'll withstand inevitable legal challenges but, should it fail, the state government can always take the same approach other state have and bar ISPs violating net neutrality from receiving state contracts.
