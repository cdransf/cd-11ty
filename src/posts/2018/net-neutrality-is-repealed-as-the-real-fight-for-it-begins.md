> So while many are understandably frustrated today, the elimination of the FCC's 2015 rules shouldn't be seen the end of net neutrality, or the end of the road. It's more like another chapter in a story that has neither a beginning nor an end. Net neutrality isn't something that simply "ends" with the creation or elimination of government guidelines. Net neutrality violations are only a symptom of a lack of competition in broadband and decades of regulatory capture.<!-- excerpt -->

I'm disappointed, naturally, about the repeal of net neutrality, the fight is far from over. From here it moves to state houses and courts, with public opinion on its side. ISPs and their allies at the FCC overplayed their hand and underestimated public backlash to the repeal, and I'd be surprised if they manage to win the fight ahead of them.
