> Twelve lawsuits filed against the Federal Communications Commission over its net neutrality repeal have been consolidated into one suit that will be heard at a federal appeals court in California.<!-- excerpt -->

> The 12 lawsuits were filed by more than three dozen entities, including state attorneys general, consumer advocacy groups, and tech companies.

> Granted having disparate state-level protections may in some ways be cumbersome, but that's again something ISPs like AT&T, Verizon and Comcast should have thought a little harder about before killing extremely popular and modest (by international standards) federal protections. Large ISP lobbyists created this mess and, unsurprisingly, they're simply refusing to own it.

I would've loved to see the FCC net neutrality repeal fail, but seeing proponents of the repeal grapple with the fallout of running roughshod over the public during the repeal process has been pretty satisfying. None of these ISPs appear to realize how unpopular they are and what they're pushing for is. I want net neutrality enshrined in legislation, but any bill ISPs or their lobbyists are involved in writing would preserve net neutrality in name only.
