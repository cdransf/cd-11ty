> "The network will deliver a 'net-neutral' competitive unfettered data offering that does not impose caps or usage limits on one use of data over another (i.e., does not limit streaming or charge rates based on type of use)," a new planning document says. "All application providers (data, voice, video, cloud services) are equally able to provide their services, and consumers' access to advanced data opens up the marketplace."

I sincerely hope more cities push to create their own, neutral networks now that the FCC has abdicated its responsibility to protect consumers from abuses by private, monopolistic ISPs.
