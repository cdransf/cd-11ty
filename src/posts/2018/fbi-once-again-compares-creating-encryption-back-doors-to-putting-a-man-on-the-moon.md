**[Chris Wray, FBI Director:](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180721/12074340282/fbi-boss-chris-wray-we-put-man-moon-so-why-not-encryption-backdoors.shtml)**

> We're a country that has unbelievable innovation. We put a man on the moon. We have the power of flight. We have autonomous vehiclesâ€¦ [T]he idea that we can't solve this problem as a society -- I just don't buy it.<!-- excerpt -->

> The "compromise" Wray wants is simple: if law enforcement has a warrant, it gets access. The solution isn't. To weaken or backdoor encryption to serve law enforcement's needs makes everyone -- not just criminal suspects -- less safe. If a hole can be used by good guys, it can be used by bad guys. And even the best guys can't prevent their tech tools from making their way into the public domain

> "When I hear 'if we can put a man on the moon, we can do this' I'm hearing an analogy almost saying "if we can put a man on the moon, surely we can put a man on the sun.'"
