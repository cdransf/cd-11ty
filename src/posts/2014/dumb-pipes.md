I can't help but agree with everything Ben Bajarin has to say in this post. Carriers and broadband providers acting as "dumb pipes" is the best outcome for consumers and I can't help but cheer every time a provider gets a step closer to that role.

I don't want any services tied to my cell or broadband providers' ecosystems. I want them to provide me with the fastest connection at the most reasonable price possible and then get out of the way.
