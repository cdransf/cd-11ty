> Droplr began as an idea between two geeks who wanted an easy way to share files with each other. So we set aside some weekends and evenings and built an app that could do just that. Over the last few years what began as a simple free Mac App, has grown into a great company dedicated to creating the best possible way to share files.<!-- excerpt -->

If this helps Droplr grow and continue as a successful business, I'm all for it. I use the service daily to shorten links, share files and post images.
