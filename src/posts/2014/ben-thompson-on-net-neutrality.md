**[Ben Thompson:](http://stratechery.com/2014/net-neutrality-wake-call)**

> It's not enough to insist that a position is morally right; it behooves us who believe in net neutrality to work through how the US can balance net neutrality with the need for ongoing broadband investment, fashion a case for our position, and then build a political movement that makes our plan a reality. That is being serious.<!-- excerpt -->

This is a fantastic piece on net neutrality by Ben Thompson. This is a balanced, realistic look at net neutrality and the issues surrounding it. It's refreshing to see a pragmatic and informed discussion of the topic. Well worth the read.
