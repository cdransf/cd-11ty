<h3>Family</h3>
<p>Hanging out with and spending as much time as possible with my <strong class="highlight-text">lovely wife, kids and rescue dogs (we've got a guinea pig too).</strong></p>
<h3><a href="https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/on-getting-tattooed/">Getting tattooed</a></h3>
<p>It's been an ongoing process of recovering from sessions, resuming my exercising routine and returning for the next session. I have two chest pieces, a new piece above my left knee and we've been working away on my right arm.</p>

<p><strong class="highlight-text">Scrobbling and data ownership:</strong> <a href="https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/building-a-scrobbler-using-plex-webhooks-edge-functions-and-blob-storage/">I've been building</a> and <a href="https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/improving-my-self-hosted-scrobbling-implementation/">improving</a> my self-hosted scrobbling solution. <a href="https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/adventures-in-self-hosting-data/">I've been working to bring my movie, TV and reading data in-house too.</a></p>
<p><strong class="highlight-text">Ad and tracker-blocking:</strong> I've been updating and maintaining a list of ad and tracker-blocking tools <a href="https://github.com/cdransf/awesome-adblock">that I'm happy to take contributions to.</a> Modern advertising is awful and intrusive. <a href="https://coryd.dev/posts/2023/i-block-ads/">Do what you can to block it.</a></p>
<p><strong class="highlight-text">Fiddling with simple web components:</strong> I've been working on and incorporating some web components into this site. I've built a <a href="https://github.com/cdransf/theme-toggle">theme toggle</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cdransf/select-pagination">select-based pagination</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cdransf/api-text">one that loads text from an API</a> (used on my home page).</p>
<p><strong class="highlight-text">Encouraging folks to block AI web crawlers:</strong> <a href="https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/go-ahead-and-block-ai-web-crawlers/">they're insidious, abusive and should be blocked.</a> <a href="https://github.com/ai-robots-txt/ai.robots.txt">I'm happy to take contributions, once again,</a> as we encourage folks to block them as best they can.</p>
<h3>Mentoring</h3>
<p>I've been mentoring through <a href="https://www.underdogdevs.org">Underdog Devs</a> on and off for a few years now and find it incredibly rewarding.</p>
