Software and services that I use for work and my own enjoyment.

<h3 className="text-xl font-extrabold leading-9 tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 sm:text-2xl sm:leading-10 md:text-4xl md:leading-14">Computer setup</h3>

- Midnight MacBook Air (2022 - M2)
- 27" Dell Monitor
- Apple Magic Keyboard with Touch ID + number pad
- Apple Magic Trackpad
- Homepod Mini for audio
- Raspberry Pi for Homebridge

<h3 className="text-xl font-extrabold leading-9 tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 sm:text-2xl sm:leading-10 md:text-4xl md:leading-14">Desk and chair</h3>

- My desk is a custom made corner desk I bought on Etsy years ago. It's sturdy, has tons of storage and finally arrived with a chip on the surface to add some character after the first one got lost by the freight company on the journey from Michigan to Los Angeles. I probably _wouldn't_ repeat the experience, but I do love the desk.
- [Herman Miller Aeron chair](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/): it's pretty comfortable and makes swiveling around my corner desk easy.

<h3 className="text-xl font-extrabold leading-9 tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 sm:text-2xl sm:leading-10 md:text-4xl md:leading-14">macOS + iOS</h3>

- [Mona](https://mastodon.social/@MonaApp): endlessly configurable and yet still easy to use I enjoy Mona's take on Mastodon and use it as my go-to client across all of my devices.
- [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com): I love the simplicity and stability of NetNewsWire as an RSS client. I use a handful of Keyboard Maestro macros on macOS to quickly mark items as read and clean up the today view and another to quickly save items out to GoodLinks.
- [GoodLinks](http://goodlinks.app): a native read it later app that provides an excellent reading experience, a wealth of features and plenty of customization options. Lately I've been using it in conjunction with Safari's newly-added ability to read web pages to listen to queued items.
- [Parcel](https://parcelapp.net): it tracks deliveries and does so reliably. I've got a few rules configured in Fastmail to handle forwarding delivery emails to the app as well.

<h3 className="text-xl font-extrabold leading-9 tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 sm:text-2xl sm:leading-10 md:text-4xl md:leading-14">iOS</h3>

- [status.log](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/status-log/id6444921793): a focused and wonderfully built utility for posting to [omg.lol](https://omg.lol)'s status.lol service.
- [FontCase](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fontcase-manage-your-type/id1205074470): for managing/installing fonts.

<h3 className="text-xl font-extrabold leading-9 tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 sm:text-2xl sm:leading-10 md:text-4xl md:leading-14">macOS</h3>

- [Dato](https://sindresorhus.com/dato): to show/reference my calendar in the menubar and quickly join upcoming meetings.
- [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com): to quickly move around/organize/snap application windows. Using a Mac without it now feels like it's broken.
- [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com): an endlessly flexible app that I underutilize for quick macros and keyboard shortcuts in a number of different apps.
- [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com): used to hide or conditionally show menubar items.
- [AirBuddy](https://v2.airbuddy.app): finer-grained control over AirPods and other wireless devices.
- [Meta](https://www.nightbirdsevolve.com/meta): the _best_ utility for tagging and organizing music files on macOS.
- [Permute](https://software.charliemonroe.net/permute): a useful utility for quickly converting files to different formats.
- [SoundSource](https://rogueamoeba.com/soundsource): a handy utility for better, more granular control on macOS.
- [Sleeve](https://replay.software/sleeve): my favorite Music.app controller (it works with Spotify too). I'll always have a softspot for Bowtie and Ecoute though.

<h3 className="text-xl font-extrabold leading-9 tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 sm:text-2xl sm:leading-10 md:text-4xl md:leading-14">Dev tools</h3>

- [Nova](https://nova.app): Panic's code editor has come a long way. It's stable, fully-featured and native (VS Code is an institution at this point, but monocultures are, well, bad).
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com): a more configurable terminal than the one macOS ships with. I've used it for a long time now and it's still my go-to.
- [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin): nearly as ubiquitous as Dracula but lighter and more playful, I've started using this theme wherever I'm looking at/reading/writing code.
- [Mono Lisa](https://monolisa.dev): a relatively new find, I've been enjoying how pleasant and readable this font is (and have even gone so far as to install it on iOS via [FontCase](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fontcase-manage-your-type/id1205074470)).
