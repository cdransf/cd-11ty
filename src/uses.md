<h3 className="text-xl font-extrabold leading-9 tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 sm:text-2xl sm:leading-10 md:text-4xl md:leading-14">Computer setup</h3>

- Midnight MacBook Air (2022 - M2)
- 27" Dell Monitor
- Apple Magic Keyboard with Touch ID + number pad
- Apple Magic Trackpad
- Homepod Mini for audio
- Raspberry Pi for Homebridge

<h3 className="text-xl font-extrabold leading-9 tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 sm:text-2xl sm:leading-10 md:text-4xl md:leading-14">Desk and chair</h3>

- My desk is a custom made corner desk I bought on Etsy years ago. It's sturdy, has tons of storage and finally arrived with a chip on the surface to add some character after the first one got lost by the freight company on the journey from Michigan to Los Angeles. I probably _wouldn't_ repeat the experience, but I do love the desk.
- [Herman Miller Aeron chair](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/): it's pretty comfortable and makes swiveling around my corner desk easy.

<h3 className="text-xl font-extrabold leading-9 tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 sm:text-2xl sm:leading-10 md:text-4xl md:leading-14">macOS + iOS</h3>

- [Mona](https://mastodon.social/@MonaApp): endlessly configurable and yet still easy to use I enjoy Mona's take on Mastodon and use it as my go-to client across all of my devices.
- [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com): I love the simplicity and stability of NetNewsWire as an RSS client. I use a handful of Keyboard Maestro macros on macOS to quickly mark items as read and clean up the today view and another to quickly save items out to GoodLinks.
- [GoodLinks](http://goodlinks.app): a native read it later app that provides an excellent reading experience, a wealth of features and plenty of customization options. Lately I've been using it in conjunction with Safari's newly-added ability to read web pages to listen to queued items.
- [Parcel](https://parcelapp.net): it tracks deliveries and does so reliably. I've got a few rules configured in Fastmail to handle forwarding delivery emails to the app as well.

<h3 className="text-xl font-extrabold leading-9 tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 sm:text-2xl sm:leading-10 md:text-4xl md:leading-14">iOS</h3>

- [status.log](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/status-log/id6444921793): a focused and wonderfully built utility for posting to [omg.lol](https://omg.lol)'s status.lol service.
- [FontCase](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fontcase-manage-your-type/id1205074470): for managing/installing fonts.

<h3 className="text-xl font-extrabold leading-9 tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 sm:text-2xl sm:leading-10 md:text-4xl md:leading-14">macOS</h3>

- [Dato](https://sindresorhus.com/dato): to show/reference my calendar in the menubar and quickly join upcoming meetings.
- [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com): to quickly move around/organize/snap application windows. Using a Mac without it now feels like it's broken.
- [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com): an endlessly flexible app that I underutilize for quick macros and keyboard shortcuts in a number of different apps.
- [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com): used to hide or conditionally show menubar items.
- [AirBuddy](https://v2.airbuddy.app): finer-grained control over AirPods and other wireless devices.
- [Meta](https://www.nightbirdsevolve.com/meta): the _best_ utility for tagging and organizing music files on macOS.
- [Permute](https://software.charliemonroe.net/permute): a useful utility for quickly converting files to different formats.
- [SoundSource](https://rogueamoeba.com/soundsource): a handy utility for better, more granular control on macOS.
- [Sleeve](https://replay.software/sleeve): my favorite Music.app controller (it works with Spotify too). I'll always have a softspot for Bowtie and Ecoute though.

<h3 className="text-xl font-extrabold leading-9 tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 sm:text-2xl sm:leading-10 md:text-4xl md:leading-14">Dev tools</h3>

- [Nova](https://nova.app): Panic's code editor has come a long way. It's stable, fully-featured and native (VS Code is an institution at this point, but monocultures are, well, bad).
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com): a more configurable terminal than the one macOS ships with. I've used it for a long time now and it's still my go-to.
- [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin): nearly as ubiquitous as Dracula but lighter and more playful, I've started using this theme wherever I'm looking at/reading/writing code.
- [Mono Lisa](https://monolisa.dev): a relatively new find, I've been enjoying how pleasant and readable this font is (and have even gone so far as to install it on iOS via [FontCase](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fontcase-manage-your-type/id1205074470)).

<h3 className="text-xl font-extrabold leading-9 tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 sm:text-2xl sm:leading-10 md:text-4xl md:leading-14">Services</h3>

- <a onclick="clicky.goal('Referral: Fastmail')" href="https://ref.fm/u30190984">Fastmail</a>: the best email service available, bar-none. They're standards compliant (and often contribute to said standards), reliable and fully-featured — they even respect your privacy.
- <a onclick="clicky.goal('Referral: nextDNS')" href="https://nextdns.io/?from=m56mt3z6">NextDNS</a>: a privacy-focused, set it and forget it DNS service. I use their security features on my home network and a profile with strict ad-blocking rules on all of my devices.
- <a onclick="clicky.goal('Referral: DNSimple')" href="https://dnsimple.com/r/3a7cbb9e15df8f">DNSimple</a>: a robust, user-friendly DNS provider and registrar. I moved my domains here after my old provider was acquired.
- <a onclick="clicky.goal('Referral: Bunny.net')" href="https://bunny.net?ref=revw3mehej">Bunny.net</a>: a powerful and affordable CDN. I use it to serve assets on my personal site (most notable my now page — raw assets are fetched by Eleventy and then optimized to webp).
- <a onclick="clicky.goal('Referral: Clicky')" href="https://clicky.com/101424044">Clicky</a>: powerful and easy to understand analytics (if, perhaps, not the prettiest to look at).
- <a onclick="clicky.goal('Referral: Feedpress')" href="https://feedpress.com/?affid=34370">Feedpress</a>: they've been around for a while now and don't change much (nor do they need to), but look no further for reliable, helpful feed analytics.
- [SavvyCal](https://savvycal.com): the most pleasant scheduling solution I've found to date. It offers a number of scheduling niceties and allows visitors to overlay their own calendars for a seamless booking experience.
- [IVPN](https://www.ivpn.net): my VPN of choice for browsing outside of my home network. Privacy-focused and trustworthy.
- [Kagi](https://kagi.com): search that's actually helpful and ad-free. It's lenses feature and the ability to up/downvote and block results from different sites are indispensable.
- [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com): the best available modern RSS service. I use its actions to filter noise out of my feed as well as to star and surface my must-read feeds and newsletters.
- [forwardemail.net](https://forwardemail.net): I could route the domains I have here through Fastmail, but I prefer the simplicity of this service and the separation of email concerns.
- [Trakt](https://trakt.tv): my preferred TV and movie tracking service — it has a strong community (and isn't owned by a private equity firm).
- [The Storygraph](https://thestorygraph.com): an excellent, focused and community driven book tracking app. All it needs is RSS/Atom feeds and/or an API.
- [Slack](http://slack.com): I have a family Slack set up to avoid group text messages and am in a few other community Slacks.
- [Discord](http://discord.com): I don't _like_ Discord but, for better or worse, it's where some communities I frequent are.
- [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup): a set it and forget it remote backup solution. I have it pointed at the external storage volume I have velcroed to the back of my monitor.
- [Zoom](https://zoom.us): it works and it's ubiquitous.
