<h1 class="text-xxl font-black -leading-tight tracking-normal dark:text-gray-200 md:text-3xl text-center">Hi, I'm Cory</h1>

I'm a software developer in Camarillo, California. I enjoy hanging out with my beautiful family and 4 rescue dogs, technology, automation, [music](https://music.apple.com/profile/cdransf), writing, [reading](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/coryd), [tv](https://trakt.tv/users/cdransf) and [movies](https://trakt.tv/users/cdransf).

I build, maintain and design web applications. I've been coding professionally since 2010 with a focus on frontend technologies. I help organize [the Eleventy Meetup](https://11tymeetup.dev) and mentor for [Underdog Devs](https://www.underdogdevs.org).

I tend to write about whatever strikes me, with a focus on development, technology, automation or issues I run into with these things. This is all typically light on editing with and heavy on spur of the moment thoughts.
