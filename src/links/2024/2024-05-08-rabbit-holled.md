description: 'In November 2021, a company called Cyber Manufacture Co raised $6 million for its "Next Generation NFT Project GAMA," about a week after it incorporated with the Secretary of State of California. According to an archived version of GAMA’s website from June 1 2022, GAMA was a "decentralized organization that is sending 10K crew members into space to complete energy harnessing missions across the universe." Holding a GAMA NFT would grant you "exclusive membership to the GAMA Space Station," with other perks including "staking opportunities, tickets to GAMA studios, limited edition merch and live events." GAMA’s token promised to be "carbon-negative" and the "foundation of the GAMA economy." The "GAMA space station metaverse" would be "the destination for all 10K Crew Members, powered by Unreal Engine and proprietary AI."'
