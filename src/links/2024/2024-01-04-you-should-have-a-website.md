description: "People don’t really make personal websites anymore. The homepage of Squarespace makes it obvious that most people use websites for business and social media for “themselves.” Maybe I’m the weird one, but I think having a digital canvas where you can do anything you can think of is the coolest shit ever. For most people, different combinations of social media websites have replaced the need for a personal website, but they are not the same thing."
