description: "Emo music is about me, or sometimes it’s about you, but only in the singular. And usually “you” are a woman, or if we’re being honest a girl who is done wrong by me. This is much of what defined the genre from ‘90s to through the 2000s. It’s the Get Up Kids’ “Action & Action,” it’s Taking Back Sunday’s “Cute Without the ‘E’.” When we talk about the emo revival, we’re talking about bands moving away from the scorched-earth acoustics of Dashboard Confessional or the glossy pop-punk of Fall Out Boy — acts who helped catapult emo into an era of commercial success — and toward a dirtier, knottier sound. The emo revival represented something more than just a shift in sound. There’s a shift of perspective, too, from “me” and “you” to “us,” and it was embodied in the music of a four-piece from Worcester, Massachusetts."
