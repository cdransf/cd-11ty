description: "The first reviews are in on Apple’s Vision Pro. Does it earn a thumb’s up? Is it an 8.7? Will it be a hit? How many units have sold? Is it trending? It would be pointless for me to pretend to neutrality on this. I’m rooting for it to fail, just as much as tech reviewers are generally hoping new tech will be “transformative” or “disruptive” and testify to the world-determining relevance of their chosen beat."
