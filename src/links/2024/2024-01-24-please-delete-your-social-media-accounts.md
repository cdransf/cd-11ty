description: "Sorry. It’s yet another blog post on a personal website about how social media is bad. If you are reading this in an RSS reader, this post isn’t for you. I’m pretty certain that you already hate social media services, and have already read a dozen blog posts similar to this one that were probably written much better. So really, RSS homies can stop reading. I’m not writing this because I have fresh and interesting ideas on the subject. People I care about in real life visit this website sometimes so I want to leave this here for them to eventually find. I feel like everyone who knows me already knows how I feel. In person, my delivery is either too blunt or way too longwinded, neither of which is what they want to hear after a mild complaint about how Facebook works. This post is supposed to be well thought out and not angry."
