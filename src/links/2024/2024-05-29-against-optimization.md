description: "One of the most inescapable edicts when leading a team is the order to optimize the system towards the organizationâ€™s goals. It comes up across industries and at every conceivable stage of an organization, whether an early-stage startup optimizing for experimentation or a later-stage group optimizing for growth or an aged institution optimizing for preserving revenue."
