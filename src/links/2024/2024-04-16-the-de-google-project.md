description: "My family, like most, depends on a lot of online services. And again like most, a lot of those services come from Big     Tech giants in general and (in our case) Google in particular. And like many people, we are becoming less comfortable with that.     So I’m going to try to be systematic about addressing the problem. This post summarizes our dependencies and then I’ll post blog     pieces about updates as I work my way through the list"
