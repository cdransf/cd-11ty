description: "A robots.txt file `tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on your site`. Generally one would use this to tell a search engine which directories should be crawled, which ones shouldn`t, or to completely block from crawling your site. The file lives at the root of your site. You can see mine here."
