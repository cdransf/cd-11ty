description: "Reading the title you might be thinking `Yeah no shit Robb of course the web[1] is fantastic it`s literally the cornerstone of all commerce and communications in the modern world`. Or maybe you`re not thinking that. But I`m not talking about the web as a whole, I`m talking about the open web. The come-do-cool-things-with-our-api web. The open standards web. The indie web."
