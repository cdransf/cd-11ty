description: "Note: I wrote this before news broke about Sam Altman’s ouster from OpenAI. The industry to which I kind of, sort of belong is an odd beast. Everybody’s looking for a story, but the incentives and professional conditions often keeps them from seeing one that’s staring them in the face. What gets covered, and what doesn’t, has always confused me in this way. There appears to be so much low-hanging fruit that no one bothers to pick."
