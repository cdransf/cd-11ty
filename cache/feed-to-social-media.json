They can respond to prompts and generate vaguely intelligible text — provided the right inputs, the right human-generated inputs.Rather than engaging with content created by modeling human input, my request is this: model better behavior by avoiding it.AI generated music? Skip it.AI generated video? Don't watch it.AI generated text? Skip it — go read some lorum ipsum instead.AI generated art? Keep on scrolling.AI generated code? Don't review it.New AI feature in your favorite app? Look for something new.It's a tool, but it's an exploitative one. If you want your work valued, if you want your time valued (as you should!) then you shouldn't be engaging with tools that devalues the creative work of anyone.    Take a look at the GitHub repository for this project. (And give it a star if you feel like it.) This is a full text feed, but not all content can be rendered perfeclty within the feed.
